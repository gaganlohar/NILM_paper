Non - Intrusive Load Monitoring energy consumption.

NILM is a way to monitor energy consumption on an appliances-by-appliances basis without having to install dedicated sensors across entire house, office or building.
The technique can also be used for LOAD distinguish, monitoring, management and forecasting.

This technique provides user-friendly, smart, robust, cheap load-monitoring solutions.
